# 2023-SE-06_Lab_Task_05_DIP-

Prompt:

Write a complete Python program for LAB 5 – Spatial Filtering & Convolution using OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, fully compatible with Google Colab. The program should satisfy all Digital Image Processing lab requirements as follows:
Allow the user to upload a grayscale image and display the original image.
Add Salt & Pepper noise and Gaussian noise separately to the image and display both noisy images.
Apply the following spatial domain smoothing filters on both noisy images:
Mean Filter (3×3)
Median Filter (3×3)
Gaussian Filter (3×3)
Apply a Laplacian filter for image sharpening and display the sharpened image.
Implement a custom 3×3 convolution kernel manually using NumPy and apply it to the image.
Display all results in a clear, well-organized comparison figure with proper titles and axes turned off.
Compare the performance of each filter in terms of noise removal, edge preservation, and blurring.
Clearly identify the best filter for Salt & Pepper noise and Gaussian noise, and justify the answer.
Print a short analysis section summarizing the observations of each filter.
Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, logically structured, and suitable for direct lab submission
